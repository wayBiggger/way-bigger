  - Detailed project view with milestones
  - Project submission forms
- **Learning Tracks**: Structured learning paths by domain
- **Community Features**: Project ideas, discussions, collaboration
- **User Authentication**: Signup/login forms with validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

### ✅ Development Infrastructure
- **Docker Setup**: Complete containerization for development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Environment Management**: Proper .env configuration
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript, Black, MyPy setup
- **Setup Scripts**: Automated development environment setup

## 🚀 Ready to Run

The platform is now ready for development and testing:

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup
docker-compose up -d
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

**Access Points:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Database: localhost:5432

## 🔄 What's Working Now

1. **Complete User Journey**: Landing → Signup → Browse Projects → Start Learning
2. **Project Discovery**: Filter by difficulty, domain, time commitment
3. **Learning Tracks**: Structured paths for different skill domains
4. **Community Features**: Share ideas, discuss, collaborate
5. **Responsive UI**: Works perfectly on all devices
6. **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Beautiful Landing Page**: Hero section, feature highlights, CTA
- **Project Cards**: Rich project information with difficulty indicators
- **Interactive Forms**: Form validation, error handling, user feedback
- **Navigation**: Clean, intuitive navigation with active states
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture and user flow

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Layered Backend**: Clean separation of concerns (models, services, API)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript + Python type hints
- **Database Design**: Proper relationships and constraints
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, input validation
- **Scalability**: Docker-based deployment ready for production
